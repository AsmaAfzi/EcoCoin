# 🌱 EcoCoin
EcoCoin is a blockchain-based platform that enables individuals and small businesses to earn and trade carbon credits based on verifiable eco-friendly actions like recycling, using public transport, or conserving energy.
# 🔍 Problem
Despite national climate goals like the UAE’s Net Zero 2050, individual contributions are often overlooked. Key challenges include:
1. No tools to track or verify personal eco-actions
2. Lack of incentives or reward systems for sustainable behavior
3. Minimal public engagement due to no tangible benefits

This leads to millions of climate-positive actions going unrecognized and unrewarded.
